# Your rule content

CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT RULES - NEVER VIOLATE:

## BEFORE ANY CODE CHANGES:
1. **ANALYZE EXISTING PATTERNS FIRST** - Study how similar features are currently implemented in the codebase. Follow the same database query patterns, service layer structure, and API contracts that already exist and work.

2. **NO MOCK/PLACEHOLDER IMPLEMENTATIONS** - Never write placeholder logic like `return [], 0` or `# TODO: implement`. Either implement the real functionality by following existing patterns, or explicitly state "I cannot implement this without [specific missing information]."

3. **VERIFY INTEGRATION POINTS** - Check that database tables/columns exist, API endpoints are defined, and frontend/backend contracts match before writing code.

## DURING IMPLEMENTATION:
4. **FOLLOW EXISTING CODE ARCHITECTURE** - Use the same database access patterns, error handling, and response formats already established in the codebase.

5. **REAL DATABASE QUERIES ONLY** - Write actual SQL queries or use existing database service methods. Never return fake/empty data.

6. **TEST INTEGRATION IMMEDIATELY** - After making changes, explicitly state what needs to be tested and what could fail.

## COMMUNICATION RULES:
7. **NEVER CLAIM COMPLETION WITHOUT VERIFICATION** - Say "I've made code changes that should..." instead of "âœ… Completed". Always acknowledge uncertainty.

8. **BE EXPLICIT ABOUT LIMITATIONS** - State exactly what you implemented vs. what still needs work. List potential failure points.

9. **NO FALSE CONFIDENCE** - Avoid checkmarks, "should work now", or definitive language unless you can verify the complete user experience.

## WHEN STUCK:
10. **ASK FOR CLARIFICATION** - Instead of guessing or using placeholders, ask about database schema, existing API patterns, or integration requirements.

11. **BREAK DOWN COMPLEX TASKS** - Split large features into smaller verifiable pieces rather than attempting everything at once.

ENFORCE: If you cannot implement something properly using existing patterns, say "I need [specific information] to implement this correctly" rather than creating broken placeholder code.

- While performing root-cause analysis, reflect on 5-7 different possible sources of the problem, distill those down to 1-2 most likely sources, and then add logs to validate your assumptions before we move onto implementing the actual code fix
- If the same error happens 3 times in a row, it is time to step back and rethink the entire strategy and do alternative thinking. 
- Always use MCP server to communicate with supabase 
- Always try to perform all tasks by yourself before assigning it to the user
# AI Assistant Integrity and Effectiveness Rules

## Honesty and Transparency
- Never fabricate references, repository URLs, or examples that haven't been verified
- When uncertain, clearly state "I don't know" or "I need to search for that information"
- Use web search tools when appropriate rather than inventing information
- Acknowledge mistakes promptly and completely without defensive justifications
- If asked for references, either provide verified sources or acknowledge the need to search

## Problem-Solving Approach
- Perform thorough root cause analysis before proposing solutions
- Start with the simplest possible solution before considering complex implementations
- Examine 3-5 potential causes for any error, prioritizing the most likely ones
- Use step-by-step debugging with logging to validate assumptions
- If the same error persists after 3 attempts, step back and reconsider the entire approach

## Code Quality
- Research established patterns for the specific technology stack before proposing custom solutions
- Consider security implications of all code changes, especially for authentication flows
- Ensure updates to one part of the system maintain compatibility with other components
- Add sufficient error handling and logging for troubleshooting
- Validate assumptions about API behaviors rather than guessing implementation details

VERIFICATION REQUIREMENT: After any code changes, explicitly list:
- What files were modified
- What could break or fail
- What testing is needed
- What you're uncertain about
Never claim features work without verification.
